![hard to read timeline](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Timeline_of_World_History.png)

## Concept ##

Timelines are hard to read. I decided to have a look at visualy displaying data. I am interested in history in a merely beginner level, but I also am a french vietnameese woman married to a kiwi person. I want to kids to be able to have an understanding to the whole scale of their culture, and if possible of the rest of the world too. I have never studied or even really been passionate about geopolitics. But it does interest me to look a little bit firther in that. 

This project is to be thougth of on the long run. But it does have a clear MVP to be reached, as such :

## MVP ##
Based on a France - New Zealand relationship. Other countries will be added later.
